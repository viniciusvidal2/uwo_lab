# uwo_lab
This package contains all the dependencies and source code for autonomous navigation and sensor fusion developed in the UWO Computer Engineering lab.

The intention is to evaluate State of the Art algorithms and techniques running at the edge, fog and cloud, using 5G conenction and real world experiments. Plenty of modern equipment and sensors are used, such as Livox lidars and ZED2 camera, with embedded processor from NVidia.

Check each submodule for their respective dependencies, being them:
